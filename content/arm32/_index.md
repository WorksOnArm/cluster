## Problem statement

Execute 32-bit Arm codes in a 32-bit only environment on
a server that is capable of running both 32-bit and 64-bit 
code.

## Hosted CI options

Drone CI offers a 32-bit build environment.

Balena offers a 32-bit build environment.

## Hardware options at Packet

### Ampere eMag

The Ampere eMag 1 chip offers both 32-bit and 64-bit
execution. See the [Wikichip eMag page](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/ampere_computing/emag)
