Ed is an Internet veteran with over 30 years experience. He has extensive experience with networks at all levels – 
physical, logical, technical, social, political, and financial. He is a graduate of the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu), 
and an alumnus of Cisco Systems and Arbor Networks.

At Packet, Ed leads outreach to a wide variety of software ecosystems, 
from open source to the Enterprise.   His main project is Works on Arm, 
which helps to bring cloud native and data center software to 64-bit Arm servers.

When he’s not opening issues on Github, Ed can be found on the amateur 
radio bands as W8EMV, tinkering with a pile of Raspberry Pis, or 
coworking at Ann Arbor’s [Workantile](https://workantile.com).
