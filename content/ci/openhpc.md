[OpenHPC](https://openhpc.community/) is a Linux Foundation collaborative project that provides 
a variety of common, pre-built ingredients required to deploy and 
manage an HPC Linux cluster including provisioning tools, resource 
management, I/O clients, runtimes, development tools, and a variety 
of scientific libraries. We currently support ARM and x86_64 on t
wo OS distributions. Any site interested in deploying an HPC cluster 
on ARM can potentially benefit from one or more packaged components 
and/or validated installation recipes.

The build system is based on a standalone instance of the Open 
Build Service that is at https://build.openhpc.community .
A c1.large.arm instance is used to run OpenSUSE for the 
OBS build farm to support dedicated ARM builds.
