### What infrastructure (computing resources and network access) do you need?

## Important reminders and logistics

Approved projects will be expected to provide credit back to Works on Arm
in the form of a logo display, blog post, Twitter post, news release, or
some other suitable acknowledgement.

Approved projects are subject to a 90 day review process for termination.
When you are done with the project or there is a change in ownership, please add comment on this issue so that we can reuse the hardware for someone else!
